The Nile River fed Egyptian civilization for hundreds of years. \nThe Longest River the Nile is 4,160 miles long—the world’s longest river. It begins near the equator in Africa and \nflows north to the Mediterranean Sea. In the south the Nile churns with cataracts. A cataract is a waterfall. Near the \nsea the Nile branches into a delta. A delta is an area near a river’s mouth where the water deposits fine soil called silt. \nIn the delta, the Nile divides into many streams. The river is called the upper Nile in the south and the lower Nile in the\nnorth. For centuries, heavy rains in Ethiopia caused the Nile to flood every summer. The floods deposited rich soil along the \nNile’s shores. This soil was fertile, which means it was good for growing crops. Unlike the Tigris and Euphrates,\nthe Nile River flooded at the same time every year, so farmers could predict when to plant their crops.\n\"\"\"\n\nnum_questions = int(input(\"How many questions do you want to generate? \"))\ndifficulty_level = input(\"Enter difficulty level (easy, medium, difficult): \").lower()\n\nwhile difficulty_level not in [\"easy\", \"medium\", \"difficult\"]:\n    print(\"Invalid difficulty level!
